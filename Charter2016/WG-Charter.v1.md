(1) WG NAME (and any acronym or abbreviation of the name): The WG name, acronym and abbreviation must not include trademarks not owned by the Organization, or content that is infringing, harmful, or inappropriate.

Consent and Information Sharing Work Group (CISWG)
(2) PURPOSE: Please provide a clear statement of purpose and justification why the proposed WG is necessary.

The amount and frequency of sharing of information about, by, and from individuals has outpaced the ability to manage it.  The system of privacy policies and terms of use are not sufficient for personal data control.  In this context, this work group is chartered to develop open specifications that support an infrastructure for personal data control.

The individual is the optimal point of integration and control for managing personal information services.  The role of this WG is to shepherd new specifications by which personal information can flow under the control of the individual, improving the relationship between demand and supply with personal data control.
 
(3) SCOPE: Explain the scope and definition of the planned work.
The founding Work Group participants recognize that developers are working in an ever-evolving heterogeneous environment that requires interoperability of identity services (i.e. identity- and SOA-enabled applications), and integration of policy assets both internal and external to the enterprise. In order to advance the identity-enabled marketplace - specifically application domains that rely upon information sharing, privacy, consent and trust this Work Group is chartered to:
Become and/or initiate an active public discussion forum for the collection, development, and analysis of use cases, scenarios, and specifications that improve consent-driven  information sharing.
Foster awareness of and participation in open consent and sharing infrastructure from the broadest stakeholder cross-section possible, both the near-term use case phase which has taken place in this working group, the mid-term specification and practical framework build phase (where we are now), and the long-term adoption of the specifications by SSO (Standards Setting Organisations).
Develop guidance and supporting materials  in order to advocate the adoption of specific standard practices, policies, and terms to increase the quality of consent practices. Ensuring these practices  improve compliance and trust across legal jurisdictions for information sharing.

(4) DRAFT TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: List Working Titles of draft Technical Specifications to be produced (if any), projected completion dates, and the Standards Setting Organization(s) to which they will be submitted upon approval by the Membership.
MVCR Consent Receipt: Core consent record profile for creating consent transaction receipts and records that comply with privacy regulation across jurisdictions: Projected SSO ISO - May 1st, 2016 -  v.8   v.1 by end of 2016
User Submitted Terms: Common terms that can be asserted by the individual in parallel or contrast to terms of service that manage information sharing in trusted ways. Projected SSO W3C by end of 2017

It is the intention of the Information Sharing WG to ultimately submit the specifications listed above to an appropriate Standards Settings Organization for full life-cycle maintenance. The receiving organizations will be determined on a per-specification basis.

(5) OTHER DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS: Other Draft Recommendations and projected completion dates for submission for All Member Ballot. The CISWG is open for supporting and collaborating with organizations that have specification work or standards in this space. 
 
(6) LEADERSHIP: Proposed WG Chair and Editor(s) (if any) subject to confirmation by a vote of the WG Participants.

(7) AUDIENCE: Anticipated audience or users of the work.
